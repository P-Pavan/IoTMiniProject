            A working-class family from Melbourne, Australia fights city hall after being told they must vacate their
            beloved family home to allow for infrastructural expansion.
            <br> <br>
            A Melbourne family is very happy living where they do, near the Melbourne airport (according to Jane
            Kennedy, it's "practically their back yard"). However, they are forced to leave their beloved home, by the
            Government and airport authorities. 'The Castle' is the story of how they fight to remain in their house,
            taking their case as far as the High Court.
