            Everyone has a part of themselves they cannot show to anyone else.
            <br> <br>
            At a time when all nations of the world were involved in a fierce war of information happening behind closed
            doors, Ostania and Westalis had been in a state of cold war against one another for decades. The Westalis
            Intelligence Services' Eastern-Focused Division (WISE) sends their most talented spy, "Twilight," on a
            top-secret mission to investigate the movements of Donovan Desmond, the chairman of Ostania's National Unity
            Party, who is threatening peace efforts between the two nations.
            <br> <br>
            This mission is known as "Operation Strix." It consists of "putting together a family in one week in order
            to infiltrate social gatherings organized by the elite school that Desmond's son attends."
