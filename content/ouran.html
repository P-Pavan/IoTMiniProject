            Fujioka Haruhi wins a scholarship to attend Ouran Academy, a school reserved for only the most rich and
            prestigious. Despite what other students may think of her, she cares little for physical appearances or the
            fact that she is a commoner.
            <br> <br>
            Unfortunately for Haruhi, her high school days take a sudden turn when she stumbles upon the Host Club, an
            elite club filled with super rich and beautiful boys who use their specific traits and charms to entertain
            young ladies. Even worse, Haruhi accidentally breaks an 8-million yen vase in the club. Since she is unable
            to repay her debt with money, Haruhi finds herself with no choice but to work for the Host Club, becoming a
            male host herself.
