            The Big Bang Theory is a comedy about brilliant physicists, Leonard and Sheldon, who are the kind of
            "beautiful minds" that understand how the universe works. But none of that genius helps them interact with
            people, especially women. All this begins to change when a free-spirited beauty named Penny moves in next
            door. Sheldon, Leonard's roommate, is quite content spending his nights playing Klingon Boggle with their
            socially dysfunctional friends, fellow Cal Tech scientists Wolowitz and Koothrappali. However, Leonard sees
            in Penny a whole new universe of possibilities - including love.

            Sheldon Cooper is an insensitive, neurotic obsessive-compulsive who imposes his will on everyone around him
            and everyone indulges him. Leonard and Penny fight in most episodes and she finds a way to make it his
            fault. Howard , a momma's boy, swaps one domineering woman for a younger version. Rajesh ruins
            relationships. This pretty much sums up the entire series.
