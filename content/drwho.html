            Doctor Who, British science fiction television series produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation
            (BBC). The showâ€™s original run lasted 26 years, from 1963 to 1989. Remembered for its primitive special
            effects and compelling story lines, Doctor Who became a landmark of British popular culture. The series
            resumed to much acclaim in 2005.

            Doctor Who chronicled the adventures of an eccentric time-traveling scientist from the remote planet
            Gallifrey, home of the Time Lords. The Doctor, a Time Lord himself, traveled through time and space in his
            unique craft, the TARDIS, an acronym for Time and Relative Dimensions in Space. With an interior larger than
            its exterior, the TARDIS could take on various shapes to blend into its environment. Although capable of
            whisking the Doctor and his passengers to any time and any place in the universe, the craft was frequently
            parked on Earth in the form of a blue police box. Whether in England or in the far reaches of space, the
            Doctor and his colleagues battled a multitude of evils, including robots, monsters, and a twisted Time Lord.
            Certain adversaries recurred throughout the series, notably the Daleks, genocidal aliens armoured in
            robotlike suits who sought the extermination of life-forms inferior to themselves.
